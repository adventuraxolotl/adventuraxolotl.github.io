    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <h3>What is Adventuraxlotl?</h3>
    <p>
        Adventuraxolotl is a game of strategy and negotiation set in a world where amphibians rule. You must use
        your powers of persuasion to guide your nation through complex socio-economic challanges, geopolitical
        disputes, and all the great issues facing amphibian kind.

    <p>
        You win Adventuraxolotl by unifying the many factions of Lissamphibia. With so many slimy customers
        around,
        this is easier said than done!
